### projective plane

some results from [https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahbdo/FiniteProjectivePlanes.pdf](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahbdo/FiniteProjectivePlanes.pdf)

> Definition 2.1. A Projective plane P is an ordered pair of sets (p(P), l(P)), whose elements are
> called points and lines, respectively, and a relation between these sets, called incidence,
>satisfying the following axioms:
>1. Given any two distinct points, there is exactly one line incident with both of them.
>2. Given any two distinct lines, there is exactly one point incident with both of them.
>3. There are four points such that no line is incident with more than two of them.
>We say that a projective plane is finite if the number of points of the plane is finite.

points are vertices and lines are hypergraph edges. The axioms are saying
1. for any two vertives there is exactly one edge contain them.
2. for any two edges their intersection is one vertex.
3. you can find 4 vertices in the hypergraph that no edge contains more than 2 of them.


the smallest projective plane is the [Fano plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_plane)

> Theorem 2.5. for any point in the projective plane, the number of lines incident is the same
> 
> proof: take $a\in P$ and $l\in L$ such that $a\not\in l$, by axiom 1 one can see that for any point $p$ on $l$ there is a unique line incident with both $p$ and $a$, thus the number of lines incident with $a$ is the same as the number of points on $l$. then take another point $b\in P$ and consider $b$ and $l$ in the same way. $a,b$ always exist and guaranteed to be different by aixiom 3. Hence the number of lines incident with $a$ = # lines incident with $b$ = # points on $l$.
> by duality similar theorem holds for lines.
> suppose the number of lines incident with every point is $k+1$, then define the order of the projective plane to be $k$.

One can see that the number of lines and points on a projective plane are the same. Suppose the order of the projective plane is $k$ and there will be $k+1$ lines incident with each point and on each line there will be $k+1$ points. Thus the number of lines is $(k+1)n/(k+1)=n$, the same as points.


Theorem 2.5. means the corresponding hypergraph must be $k+1$-uniform and $k+1$-regular

For special(satisfying the above 3 conditions) $k+1$-uniform $k+1$-regular hypergraph we easily know the number of edges and vertices is $k(k+1)+1$, so order $n$ projective plane has exactly $n^2+n+1$ points and lines.

However not all order is possible. All known order of projective plane is prime power. The existence of finite projective planes of other orders is an open question. see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane#Finite_projective_planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane#Finite_projective_planes)


### Mutually orthogonal Latin squares(MOLS)

[Latin square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square) is just sudoku without the property of no repeated values in any of the nine blocks. Latin squares can be of size $n\times n$ not just $9\times 9$.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutually_orthogonal_Latin_squares#Thirty-six_officers_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutually_orthogonal_Latin_squares#Thirty-six_officers_problem)

from now on we only consider Latin squares of the same size.

Given two $n\times n$ Latin squares $A$ and $B$, make a new $n\times n$ square $C$(called Graeco-Latin square or Euler square or pair of orthogonal Latin squares). $C[i,j]$ is an ordered pair of $A[i,j]$ and $B[i,j]$. If there are no two cells in $C$ contains the same ordered pair, then the two latin squares are called orthogonal.

A set of Latin squares are orthogonal if and only if they are pairwise orthogonal.

Denote a set of $n\times n$ mutually orthogonal Latin squares by $\mols(n)$. I am insterested in $|\mols(n)|$.

One can see that $|\mols(n)| \leq n-1$ since
